Why is API required to communicate between front end and back end?
Because they speak different languages - Front end is developed in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Back end is developed in Java, Python etc.


Fetching JSON data:
Using Groovy's Gpath:
In groovy.json packagewe have a class called JsonSlurper that can parse json text into Groovy data structures such as Objects, maps, integers etc.
JsonSlurper jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper();
jsonSlurper.parseText('{"name":"John Doe"}');

string in json is converted to java.lang.string
object is converted to java.util.LinkedHashMap
For more details go to groovy-lang.org/json.html

Next we use Gpath expressions for navigation inside json data structure. GPath use a dot-object notation to perform object navigation.

jsonSlurper.parseText returns an object. On this object we can use: object.firstname; object.address; object.address.street

Using Jayway's Json Path:
Need to add as a dependency
It also uses dot notation.
Official doc: https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath
Operators and functions are important here.
Use jsonpath.com to test syntax

HTTP methods:
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE etc are HTTP methods and not Rest assured methods.
 
Idempotent means executing the same HTTP method repeatedly will not having effect on the server. i.e., Executing GET many times will not change anything on server. But sending POST request repeatedly (with same data) will either result in error or new resource being created.
We use HEAD method when the GET’s response is huge and we want to only check the resource size or existence. Mainly for testing purposes. This will actually avoid hitting server unnecessarily. The header we receive in response will be the same headers which we receive in a GET request.
OPTIONS request is used to get the HTTP methods supported by a resource. In the response go to headers sections and check the header – Access-Control-Allow-Methods. It will list all the methods supported. Also, Access-Control-Allow-Headers will show the content type supported by the resource.

HTTP status codes: 
  1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
   2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received,
      understood, and accepted
   3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to
      complete the request
   4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
      fulfilled
   5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently
      valid request

Mock server:
Mock server helps to send mock HTTP requests when backend is not ready and we need to test API’s. Instead of backend we can set up a mock server and hit it to test API’s.
In postman create a mock server (copy the mock server URL after creation) and create a collection. Create a request under collection using mock server URL copied earlier and put /get as end point.
Now we have created an API which needs to be tested without a backend. So, we define the expected response in the mock server and send test API request. It should get response as we defined earlier. To achieve this, in postman, within the request click on examples. Create a new example and edit the response body and write the response that we need. i.e., expected response. Also set the expected HTTP status code.
Now go back to request and hit the mock server. The response body and status code should match the expected response we defined in previous step. The API spec helps us to know the below things:
1.	URL and endpoint of the API that is under test.
2.	Expected response.
We can use the above info of API spec to set up the mock server with expected response.
Note: If for same API end point if you want to test different status codes and response, then define those examples for the same API (Define expected status code and response body). Now add a header in the API request called – x-mock-response-code and add required status code value to it. Now the mock server will respond as per what we defined in the header for the same API request.
To mock header request and responses, add these custom headers in mock request
1. header : value1 (This header value will determine which mock example's response is expected)
2. x-mock-match-request-headers : header (Value of this header should be the header name defined in previous step) 
Now define two examples where we need to set header : value 1 and header : value2
Define response body that is to be sent to calling request. Also define custom response header.
When mock request is sent verify the response body and header. They should match the headers defined in example 1 or 2. 

Rest assured:
Install eclipse, create new maven project and install rest assured and TestNG dependencies. Also install testing plugin.
In test case file include static imports:
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;
1 right click on your project 2 click on build path 3 click on configure build path 4 click on add library 5 select TestNG 6 click on next 7 click on finish 8 click on apply and close
This will add TestNG library to your project

Hamcrest: (API Doc: http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/javadoc/)
-> Hamcrest is a well known assertion library used for unit testing along with JUnit.
-> Hamcrest can be used along with Rest Assured for assertions.
-> Uses matcher classes for making assertions

Adv:
-> Human readable and in plain english
-> Code is neat and intuitive
-> Provides thin methods like "is" and "not", also called as decorators, for more readibility

Hamcrest Vs TestNG
-> Readibility
-> Descriptive error messages
-> Type Safety

Collection matchers (List, Array, Map, etc.)
==============================================
hasItem() -> check single element in a collection
not(hasItem()) -> check single element is NOT in a collection
hasItems() -> Check all elements are in a collection
contains() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in a strict order
containsInAnyOrder() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in any order
empty() -> Check if collection is empty
not(emptyArray()) -> Check if the Array is not empty
hasSize() -> Check size of a collection
everyItem(startsWith()) -> Check if every item in a collection starts with specified string

hasKey() -> Map -> Check if Map has the specified key [value is not checked]
hasValue() -> Map -> Check if Map has at least one key matching specified value
hasEntry() -> Maps -> Check if Map has the specified key value pair
equalTo(Collections.EMPTY_MAP) -> Maps [Check if empty]
allOf() -> Matches if all matchers matches (Works only with strings)
anyOf() -> Matches if any of the matchers matches (Works only with strings)

Numbers:
greaterThanOrEqualTo()
lessThan()
lessThanOrEqualTo()

String:
containsString()
emptyString()
