public class AgileMethodology {
 //AGILE methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
//In the Agile model, both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model.
//Difference between agile and waterfall:
//Agile is incremental and waterfall is sequential.
//Testing and development are concurrent. In waterfall testing starts after development as separate parts are not fully functional.
//Customer can have a look at the features early. In waterfall customer the see the application at the end of project.
//Agile process - Scrum, XP etc.
//It consists of three roles, and their responsibilities are explained as follows:
//Scrum Master: Master is responsible for setting up the team, sprint meeting and removes obstacles to progress
//Product owner:The Product Owner creates product backlog, prioritizes the backlog and is responsible for the delivery of the functionality at each iteration
//Scrum Team: Team manages its own work and organizes the work to complete the sprint or cycle
//Product backlog: This is a repository where requirements are tracked with details on the no of requirements(user stories) to be completed for each release.
//It should be maintained and prioritized by Product Owner, and it should be distributed to the scrum team. 
//Team can also request for a new requirement addition or modification or deletion.
//Process flow of Scrum Methodologies:
//Each iteration of a scrum is known as Sprint
//Product backlog is a list where all details are entered to get the end-product
//During each Sprint, top user stories of Product backlog are selected and turned into Sprint backlog
//Team works on the defined sprint backlog
//Team checks for the daily work
//At the end of the sprint, team delivers product functionality
