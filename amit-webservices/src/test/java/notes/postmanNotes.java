//HTTP requests: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
//Get call does not require any payload.
//Post call requires payload.
//JSON response is a key value pair.
//We send request for a POST call, get response in JSON format, select a event id and make another post call with that event id to verify if the reponse is correct.
//We receive end point URL's to test. Need to send get calls obtain keys from response in JSON form and paste the same key in post calls to get corresponding info.
