//To use jasmine data provider include the dependency: jasmine-data-provider in your package.json file.
//Go to the project path and run the command: npm install.
//It basically helps to provide multiple sets of data to the specs.
//We can use module.exports to tie up with data file object and then in test case file we can use var obj = require("./data.js");
//i.e. obj.datadrive.firstinput can be used to replace hard coded data values in spec. 
//The above method will help to read only 1 set of data. So we need to use jasmine data provider and make changes to data file:
//Add multiple data sets under a parent object. Then export the entire object using module.exports. For details see data.js file.
//Once the data file is ready with multiple data sets, we need to wrap the test case with a jasmine concept called "using".
//Also need to import jasmine data provider as it is not a core part of Jasmine and is external.For details see data.js file and spec TC001.js.
