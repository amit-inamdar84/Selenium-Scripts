Protractor is and end to end testing framework for Angular and Angular JS applications.
Webdriver+Angular support = Protractor
The only stable framework to automate angular apps. It is developed and maintained by Angular team.
It is a node.js program built on top of webdriverJS. So it uses Javascript for writing tests.
Tools to be used along with Protractor - Node.js, Jasmine, Javascript, Protractor API.
Difference between Javascript and Typesecript:
Both are same. Typescript has additional features(OOPS).
During framework building syntax differs.
If javascript we use for framework we use Jasmine.
If typescript is used we use Cucumber.

Installation:
D:
cd D:\Best Buy API\api-playground
Download node.js
Set environment variable and point to C:\Program Files\nodejs (Optional)
Restart cmd.
install npm. Node package manager is a repository tool like Maven.
Verify installations - node -v and npm -v
Execute all below commands in folder where nodejs resides.
Install protractor using command - npm install -g protractor
npm stores all softwares in this path which is invisible - C:\Users\Amit\AppData
The above command will install both protractor and webdriver-manager.
Type protractor --version to verify.
In future if we need to update webdriver manager use - webdriver-manager update
First start selenium server - webdriver-manager start.
This will make protractor tests to send requests to server to control a
local browser. It is an intermediate between our code and browser.
URL to access - http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
Webstorm is Javascript editor which is paid tool.
Download Eclipse IDE for Javascript and web developers (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-09/r/eclipse-ide-web-and-javascript-developers)
The above link has latest version eclipse. Did not have Javascript project creation capability. So installed
old eclipse version. Later got clarification from eclipse community that any general project works.
As of now will use old eclipse.

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
Quick start guide: https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite
Describe - Test suite
It - Test case/Test file - .js file
A test case is called spec in Jasmine terminology.
Every spec should have describe and it block. i.e. specs should have a parent.

Configuration file - Similar to testng.xml. 
Whether it is spec or config file, all are .js files.
Config file contents:
exports.config = {
		seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
		specs: ['Spec1.js']
};

By default protractor test will run in Chrome. For other browsers we have to specify.
exports.config = {
		seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
		specs: ['Spec1.js'],
		capabilities: {
			  'browserName': 'firefox'
			}
};
During protractor installation when we run webdriver-manager update firefox and chrome driver are downloaded by protractor. We can see them in the folder:
C:\Users\AMIT\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\node_modules\webdriver-manager\selenium
However IE driver is not downloaded by default. We need to stop selenium server and run the command webdriver-manager update --ie and then start the server.
Now we can mention in config file like below:
exports.config = {
		seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
		specs: ['Spec1.js'],
		capabilities: {
			  'browserName': 'internet explorer'
			}
};
We can comment the seleniumAddress line in config file and run the tests without server. However it is preferred to run with server as there may in inconsistencies in test
run in firefox and IE.
Protractor tests and Angular apps are not much supported in IE.


Test runner file prep
Go to folder: C:\Users\AMIT\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules and copy protractor folder.
Paste the folder in eclipse under the project folder
Right click on project and select Run as>>Run Configuration
Select node.js application and click New Launch icon.
Select your current protractor eclipse project.
In main file browse protractor folder for built>>cli.js file.
In 2nd tab for arguments,write config file name. In this case it is configuration.
Click apply and close the window. This ends the run config part.

Running spec:
Go to Run>>Run configurations>>Select required node.js application and click Run.

Auto code suggestions:
Go to Eclipse marketplace and install the plugin Angular JS Eclipse.
Restart eclipse.
Go to window>>preferences and verify if Angular JS option is available.
Right click on project and select Configure>>Convert to tern project.
In modules window select protractor.
Click apply and close.

Non angular apps:
If you need to navigate to a page which does not use Angular, you can turn off waiting for Angular by setting browser.waitForAngularEnabled(false). This can be specified
just in the test scripta as first line in it section of spec. i.e. before launching browser.

Blog on asynchronous JavaScript: Soham Kamani.

JavaScript is asynchronous whereas Java and Python are synchronous. i.e. code does not run line by line sequentially. JavaScript will not wait for a step to complete. It will proceed
with next step.
Every JavaScript step returns promise.
Promise is the state of your step.
3 states: Pending, Resolved and Rejected.
90% (All actions we perform on browser) of protractor API will not move to next step until promise is resolved.
10% (If you want to retrieve anything from browser) have no support of promise resolving.

Most challenging in protractor is installation and resolving promises.

Pending learning: Jasmine documentation, assertions (https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction), Protractor support for Microsoft Edge.
